1. What informed your choice of technologies for this task?

I choose to use NodeJS for APIs because it's very easy to set up.
I choose to build the front with ReactJS because I am very convinient with it.
I store data on MongoDB.


2. What is a messaging queue?

A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer.

1. A user complained that your app takes 3 seconds to come up when they launch it, what are the possible causes to look into?

Because I use ReactJS for the frontend, thereâ€™s no pre-rendering. I will check the data loading before the DOM is rendered. They are the possible cause for slow loading.


1. What are In-memory databases, when are they required?

In-memory databases are purpose-built databases that rely primarily on memory for data storage, in contrast to databases that store data on disk or SSDs. In-memory databases can persist data on disks by storing each operation in a log or by taking snapshots.

In-memory databases are ideal for applications that require microsecond response times or have large spikes in traffic such as gaming leaderboards, session stores, and real-time analytics.
